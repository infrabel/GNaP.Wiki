The GNaP theme uses ```Ace - Responsive Admin Template``` as it's base theme, which is licensed under [Extended License](https://github.com/infrabel/GNaP.Web.Themes/blob/master/custom/ace/LICENSE-Ace), our license covers redistribution and usage by you. However, if you would like to show your support to the original author, you can [buy a Single application license here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/ace-responsive-admin-template-WB0B30DGR?ref=cc), it's quite cheap after all.
