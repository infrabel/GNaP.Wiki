GNaP.Tooling.Wiki
=========

We utilise a wiki to combine all our documentation in a central place. We named this place Athena, after the Greek goddess of wisdom.

As a platform we used [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), combined with a bunch of plugins to enable us to:

  * Utilise templates to easily stub new pages
  * Have Single Sign-On with Active Directory
  * Mark pages as favorites
  * Easily create overview pages

We also styled it using our [GNaP.Web.Themes](https://github.com/infrabel/GNaP.Web.Themes) project to make everything consistent.

All of this is hosted on an IIS webserver, running on Windows Server 2012 R2.

Getting all of this to work together can be quite a bit of work, which is why we bundled everything with a nice installer, to allow other enterprises and/or startups to easily setup a similar environment.

## Usage

 * Clone the repository.
 * Open a prompt and navigate to the directory you cloned to.
 * Run ```install.cmd``` to access the installation menu.
 * Depending on your needs, you can install all required prerequisites, as well as the bundled DokuWiki, our graphical modifications with plugins, our sample structure and some sample content.
 * [Read the documentation](https://github.com/infrabel/GNaP.Tooling.Wiki/wiki) to read more on how to configure your installation.
