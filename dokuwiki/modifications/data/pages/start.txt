====== Welcome ======

Hello **@NAME@**, and welcome to the Athena information center (or **info** in short) which centralizes information and documentation. The goal is to facilitate smoother integration, interaction and follow-up between build, run and competence center teams. Thank you for your contributions and we hope you like the place and decide to stay.

The sidebar provides an easy access to common sections:

  * [[favorites|Favorites]] provides an overview of your starred pages.

The following will get you started:
  * [[technologies:dokuwiki:guidelines:formatting-syntax:start|Formatting Syntax]] describes the required syntax to use when editing pages.
  * [[technologies:dokuwiki:playground:start|Playground]] lets you experiment to get to know the syntax.
